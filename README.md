# Module-5-Challenge
In this repository you will find a .ipynb file named Financial Planner, in this file we will create a Financial Planner for Emergencies, create a Financial Planner for Retirement and finally run a Monte Carlo simulations to forecast the portfolio performance 30 years from now
# Part 1 Personal Finance Planner
We will be pulling data from Crypto APIs and use them to create a financial planner for credit unions member.
We Will then asses the financial health of the credit union's members
Plot a pie chart to visualize the composition of personal savings.
# Part 2 Retirement Planning
In this section, I use Alpaca API to fetch historical closing prices for a retirement portfolio and then Use the MCForecastTools toolkit to create Monte Carlo simulations to project the portfolio performance at 30 years, 10 years and 5 years. 
Plot the simulation results and the probability distribution/confidence intervals.
